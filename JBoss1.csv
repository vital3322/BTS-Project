MVN: Dependecies in the EAR should not also exist in the WEB-INF/lib dir of the WAR,JBNET-2407,12360951,Bug,Resolved,JBNET, JBoss Network - Support (CLOSED),software,frank.merenda,"JBoss Network is a value add service offering for JBoss, Inc. customers.",,Major,Done,jsanda,jsanda,jsanda,04/Jun/08 5:07 PM,04/Jun/08 9:44 PM,29/Nov/16 3:16 PM,04/Jun/08 9:44 PM, CSP-i-2008-4,, CSP-i-2008-4,,Maven,,,,0,"Dependencies that are appearing at the EAR level (jboss-network-csp.ear/<deps>) are also appearing in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAR file. This is because the jbossnetwork-war project inherits all of those dependencies from its parent, jbossnetwork. There seem to be two immediate solutions:

1. Create a new project. Call it something like jbossnetwork-deps. Move all of the dependencies declared in jbossnetwork into this project. jbossnetwork-war can then easily exclude all of those dependencies and explicitly declare the few dependencies that should be in WEB-INF/lib.

2. Declare and exclude each dependency from jbossnetwork in jbossnetwork-war.

The first solution results in more overhead initially because we have to update the poms for each of the modules listed in jbossnetwork/pom.xml. With the second solution, we need to update the pom for the war project every time dependencies change in its parent; consequently, the first solution presents less maintenance in the long run.

It should be noted that I do not feel that either of these solutions is ideal.I do not think we can arrive at a more robust solution until we have had a chance to straighten out and organize our projects, which will take some time. For example, we probably want to have a pom project for our EJBs, and this is where we would declare our EJB-specific dependencies. Then me might provide ""templates""  for other types of components. Finally, we only declare those dependencies that are common across everything in the highest level poms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,,1|hzi4f3:,166146,,,,,,,1,,,"04/Jun/08 7:32 PM;jsanda;Clarification. Currently, no JAR files are packaged in WEB-INF/lib because the war plugin is configured to exclude all JAR files. We need to remove that exclusion in order to include needed JAR files.

I wound up implementing the second solution because with the first solution we lose project inheritance. All of the jars in WEB-INF/lib are now the same as those with the ant build.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is only happening with an invalid login. We have tested with an invalid password to generate this exception. It seemed like the UserService was returning a user object with all of its fields nulled out.  I spoke with Chris Duryee, and he was watching the response sent back as I submitted an invalid login request. He verified that the service is in fact returning null. I concluded that the issue had to be somewhere with Axis 2 and/or xmlbeans which we are using as the underlying data binding framework. My initial thought was that I had screwed something up during the maven migration. This prompted me to test with the ant build, and I was able to produce the same NPE with the ant build (and Axis 2). 

For some reason xmlbeans is giving back a non-null object even though the service returns null. I do however think that I found a work around with the following code:

VerifyPasswordResponseDocument response = stub.verifyPassword(doc);
boolean isNull = response.getVerifyPasswordResponse().isNilOut();

In the case of an invalid password, isNilOut returns true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JBNET-2264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,,1|hzi4xb:,166228,,,,,,,,,,"31/May/08 10:21 PM;jsanda;I committed a fix in revision 3797. I added the following call in both getUserByCanonicalIdAndPassword() and in validateUser():

I have deployed an ear with this change on cspserver2 and tested logging in with an invalid password. No NullPointerException was generated.",12/Jun/08 5:19 PM;jsanda;This is code complete.

When a JBoss ticket is created, the ""base group"" for a ticket should not be the product escalation group.   These queries show a ticket created by the CSP in QA where the ticket base group is the escalation product group.

It *may* be that if the product team member is the first to reply rather than the SEG team member, or if a SEG team member chooses to view the ticket as the product group, then the base group is set to the escalation product group.  I'm not sure how it gets into this state.

Problem:

I am testing the I-T QA instance and found a problem. When I try 
""Escalate to Bugzilla"" on issue #177326, after I filled in all the 
information:

Product: RHEL5
Component: krb5 Version 5.0
Keywords: defect/bug
And left the last page unchanged and then click ""Finish"", it reported an 
error:

Bugzilla creation failed: Application failed during request 
deserialization: not well-formed (invalid token) at line 8, column 64, 
byte 206 at 
/usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/XML/Parser.pm 
line 187

And I have attached the screenshot.

I have try ""Escalate to Bugzilla"" on issue #130491 and it is success. So 
I wonder that the problem is related to some Chinese content on #177326, 
which is used to test i18n capability.

Feel free to contact me for more information.

I noticed CSP enters new entry in ticket_groups upon case creation in
this order:

 - product queue
 - JBoss SEG queue
 - JBoss customer queue

And in the tickets table, CSP use the product queue as the gid.

This can cause weirdness for Issue-Tracker. Here is how Issue-Tracker
handles the ordering:

 - Customer queue
 - SEG queueu
 - product queue

In I-T, the gid is Customer queue.

It would avoid problems if CSP can use the same ordering... Or at least,
put Customer queue in first for ticket_groups table.

So, the frustration is that we've associated legacy entitlements to a specific user, and the expectation is that the other users on the account would see those that are enterprise entitlements.   Is this the way it was designed, or are we supposed to be picking up the legacy entitlements for all users in an org?

Looking at the code, the license is set to the current date if the user does not have an entitlement for JBoss ON. I added an entitlement and got this:

So it appears to be working as long as the user has an entitlement for it. 

Need to check with Frank to see if we should change the code to add some time to the expiration if the user has no entitlement for it?

Nathan","23/Apr/08 12:16 PM;nathan.lugert;Found a couple of problems:
1. When finding the latest opportunity/entitlement expiration date, it was only checking legacy entitlements and not entitlements from entitlement service or sku's
2. Using the wrong method when checking for access to enterprise manager. There is a new method that is a work around for displaying Operations Network downloads. Changed the LicenseServlet to use the new workaround. 

I verified that the user has a sku entitlement for JBoss - Operations Network Monitoring. I then found the latest opportunity expiration date (2010-04-27). So the outcome of the License Servlet should be one month after the opportunity ends or 2010-05-27. Here is the outcome:

<license key=""4f1dca453038334c217f8abc3199c30d"">
<license-owner name=""Connie Hunt"" email=""ch9578"" phone=""NA"" key=""7f0f165e60d72eb618e95421ecd22743""/>

</license>

Looks like a winner. 

To Test:

Change 2 would create this line: ""then Red Hat requires that you call into Red Hat Global Support line"". If I'm not mistaken the second ""Red Hat"" is a possessive noun and therefore needs an apostrophe. 

on the web sev1 alert, it looks like this:
then Red Hat requires that you call into Red Hat's Global Support line.

Also,
Should I change ""office hours"" to business hours like the web alert?

This includes items that have been marked as ""removed"" and ""obsolete"".  This is because we have no idea of knowing when a user last received the feed, and so they need to be notified of a software item if it has been modified in some way so that their local copy of the meta data will be updated.

Ideally, we could add a simple ""lastUpdated"" param with each RSS request so that the feed would only contain items that have been added/updated since that date, but because we don't currently have that functionality (neither on the JON side, nor the CSP side), we must request the entire feed.  Within JON, the feed is parsed, and new items are added to the JON software list, and old items are updated or removed.  Because the entire feed is requested each time, any software item added to the CSP can never be deleted from the RSS feed and it will continue to grow as new software is added.  Currently the feed for all software items is over  4.5 MB.

I recommend exploring the possibility of adding that ""lastUpdated"" param to both JBoss ON and the CSP.  I'll volunteer to make the necessary changes to the CSP code base, as I know the CSP team is swamped with other issues.  Also - if there are other ideas as to how to solve this -- please throw them out.

JBoss ON 2.0 is due out at the end of April - if possible it would be nice to get this strategy ironed out so it can be included in the 2.0 release, even though the corresponding CSP side may not be ready in time? thoughts?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,1|hzi5l3:,166335,,,,,,,4,,,"09/Jul/08 5:44 PM;mamburn;Moved to Bugzilla

Copying from an email Mike Amburn wrote:

The problem with OS X and Safari is an issue with the way Mac pushes language preference to integrated apps (like Safari). OS X will only allow a single language preference, providing no cascading. Likewise, Safari uses WebKit, which has a long known limitation of a single language setting. Consequently, there's no way to create a soft cascade of language support using OSX and Safari. Therefore, if a user has their OS language set to French, Safari will only ask for French; and we don't have a French localization, hence the output on the screenshot. That said, the CSP *should* realize it doesn't have that localization and provide the default localization, which is currently [us-en]. However, there seems to be a bug in the CSP's internationalization implementation where it's unable to do so. Since Firefox uses it's own independent language settings, which do usually cascade with an eventual English value, the CSP will return the [en-us] localization for Firefox users with a non-supported localization. Consequently, as a short term workaround, Mac users should be able to use Firefox with no issue; repairing the CSP will be required to support any non-English Safari users.

I am not aware of the issue with Windows, but it may follow the same path. It may be that IE on Vista is driven in the same way. Running IE in a English Windows environment does not exhibit any problems that I know of, and IE7 in an English Windows XP environment does not exhibit any problems. Thus, again, using Firefox may be the only short term solution.

 I hope the above information is useful. I'll leave to you/Lee/Frank to decide on how/when to fix the root issue.

 -M- ","19/May/08 4:34 PM;frank.merenda;Currently the CSP does not gracefully fail back to the default language of English for IE users if the browser language of preference  is not English, Japanese, or Traditional Chinese.
To recreate
1) Launch IE
2) Set browser language preference to French
3) Go to CSP front page

As I understand it, IE is not defaulting to English in the same way that Firefox does.
Thanks
Lee ","27/May/08 9:45 AM;lmewshaw108;
There is a defect somewhere in locale manager or localization packages in CSP such that default locale is not recognized.  Impact is that it knows en_US, Chinese and Japanese locale; any request for any other locale will end up displaying the key codes.  This does not occur with Firefox since Firefox sends multiple locales.  Safari on the Mac and IE on Windows will send the operating system locales, so for example when you set Windows to French, IE will request French.   We need someone to go into the locale manager and other internationalization packages and determine why it is not recognizing a default locale.

I've spoken with our network engineering team managers, and I'm told
that the continuing investigation and work towards resolving this has
been de-prioritized. Due to higher priority issues and short staff, IT
is unable to continue to work the problem.    This should be treated as
a ""known bug, won't fix"" for the foreseeable future.  The only available
workaround that leaves us with is to instruct the customers to use
Firefox for downloading content.  I will be looking at ways to
incorporate this text into the CSP itself via a code change.

Please note that the CSP team does *not* want this to be a ""known bug, will not fix"", but we were 
told that was the resolution from SOC because of other more pressing issues that the group must 
address before they can get to this issue, which we totally understand. There's only so many 
resources to go around.

I just wanted everyone to be clear that we view this as a high-priority issue. It's not closed in 
our minds, and I have the issue open in JIRA and it's still on our radar to get fixed whenever SOC 
can free up resources to work on the issue. Our paying customers can not download anything in 
internet explorer, and we get complaints about it all the time.

I did inspect the header on a download and saw that we are sending ""Cache-control:no-cache"" header.  I don't think the solution is to change the registry as this article suggests :)  Only workaround in the article is

    WORKAROUND
    To work around this problem, use a hypertext reference (HREF) to load the document.
    Note This workaround works only if the server uses the ""cache-control:no-store"" header.


That put me onto another thread of googling, particularly after I looked at the headers.

Another suggestion here:
http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoSendFilesFast

    Internet explorer stalled on ""getting file information"", and could never complete downloads until I added the following:
    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'must-revalidate'


Other suggestions here:
http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web_Development/Web_Languages-Standards/PHP/Q_22007220.html
It's php, but the header construction i thought was interesting:

    header('Pragma: public');
    header('Cache-control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0');
    header('Expires: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT');
    header('Content-type: application/force-download');
    header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: Binary');
    header('Content-length: '.filesize($filepath));
    header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename=' . $filename);
","12/Jun/08 11:15 AM;lmewshaw108;Another posting found: 

As far as I can tell, IE6 and IE7 have ""interesting"" interpretations of the cache-control directive when set no-cache or no-store. There are a number of Microsoft Knowledge Base articles about this problem but none are specific to IE7, as far as I've found. Many of the KB articles are misleading or even contradictory.

The main problem is that Internet Explorer strictly interprets a combination of SSL (https) and ""cache-control: no-cache"" as ""do not save encrypted pages to disk.""


* The following Pragma and Cache-Control lines are necessary
* as the overcome an issue that IE has in some server configurations
* when the no-cach header is sent. The two lines override these
* headers, allowing IE to proceed. When not turned on, the error IE
* provides is:
* Internet Explorer cannot download <item URL here instead of item file name> from <domain>.
*
* Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either
* unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later.

IT issue # 161082

Hi issue tracker admins,

I am unsure what to expect of the SBT field. Whether GK/ SLA Breach is
on or off as soon as my case turns to WORH it does not get updated or it
disappears altogether. From that point onwards I support the cases
almost blindly (other than remembering when the customer last answered).
Please issue tracker admins have a look at these cases (currently in
WORH), although other cases I own (but not in WORH status) also show the
same symptoms.

When a case is changed in issue tracker from one group to another (escalated) notifications go out when a change to the case is made.

The users are not getting the initial notifications that they have new cases in their queue (A new case has been entered in your queue).

I believe that this is what is happening:

- csp sends notifications on case changes, new attachment, new comment, status change, etc. All users in the product group.
- csp sends notification of new case to all people in the product group when a new case is created.
- if a case is in a group, and gets escalated, i.e. from jboss support to jboss - ON, the ON group never gets any notification 
  at all on initial assignment of the case. They will get subsequent notifications.

I believe that what is happening is:
- case escalated to internal jboss group
- case doesn't change anything else
- no notification is being sent out
- IT doesn't send out the notification because it's a jboss group.

Suggestion:
When a case is escalated to another group inside of issue tracker, send the notification every time, not just when it's a non-jboss group.

I do not know if this will solve the issue, because I don't know IT well enough. Please feel free to disagree with the suggested solution.

This may be from users that were migrated by GK, *but* the users should still have their canonical_id's set when they log in if they hit user service.

So there are two possible fixes in my head:

- (1) the sql file to update migrated users's canonical_id if the ""createUser"" works
  correctly when a user is created when loggin in via userservice.
- (2) the csp, to *always set* canonical_id when a user logs in via userservice. This should be
      during a ""add user"" *and* during a ""update user"" when a user logs in.

I think that #2 will solve this issue 100% of the time, and we certainly need to make sure that this works correctly. I believe that the issue is probably that we are not updating the canonical_id of a user if the user exists already.

I do not know if we need to do #1 as well. Needs to be determined.

My guess is that GK migrated users, and those users are logging in and hitting the UserService, but the canonical_id is not being set, because the user already exists.

An entitlement for Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) should enable access to JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS). When a user has an EAP entitlement/subscription , but not a JBDS subscription and tries to download JBDS, she will get an error.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Log into the CSP with fmerendagit/redhat

2. Delete all subscriptions

DELETE FROM customer_entitlement_cache
WHERE user_cache_id = 92

3. Grant subscription for EAP

INSERT INTO customer_entitlement_cache 
(user_cache_id, canonical_account_number, product_sku, end_date,  is_active, description) 
VALUES
(92, 940527, 'MCT1149', '2009-12-31', 1, 'JBoss Application Platform')

4. Go to Software Downloads

5. Select JBoss Developer Studio from the sidebar menu

6. Try to download any of the files for JBDS. It should result in an error page being rendered.

Additional Notes:
The product sku mappings are such that an EAP entitlement should enable access to JBDS. Our implementation of these mappings at the application code level is not consistent with these mappings. When the user sends a request to download JBDS, we check that the user has access to the requested software. We throw an exception when the user does not have access, and in this case we incorrectly throwing an exception as a result of the inconsistencies of how the sku mappings have been implemented in application code.","QA, PROD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,3.0,,1|hzi1vz:,165736,,,,,,,,,,"19/Feb/08 9:22 AM;jsanda;A fix for this has been checked into cvs and is on QA.

I need your help today please picking up on some Request for Changes from the JBoss guys

What I'd like you to work on is related to changes I think in Gatekeeper.  We have an RFC for the separation of the process that does Time to Service Breach calculations from the process that sends the breach notifications.  By separation, I mean into separate GK processes so that if they want to turn off the breach notifications, they can turn those off and it would not affect the TSB calculator. 
Once you have them separated, we'd like to change the service breach notifier as follows - (and yes, this is a bit of a ""hack"" so if you want to counter propose a solution, I'm all ears) - change the service breach notification so that if the service breach time is older than 15 minutes, don't send the notification.   The intent of this RFC is to get it down to sending just one ""case has breached sla"" message.  Right now, as they requested originally, it is sending every 10 minutes.  This means that if a case is sitting in breach state, then it is sending the same message every 10 minutes.

I think this is going to take some time, but if you're able to bang this one out quickly let me know and I have more for you :)

Thanks!
Lee

It looks like the notification emails are correctly I18N. Putting this in jira as a bug so we can look at it.

Currently only the latest comment time is used.  The comment time that should be used is the earliest comment made after the last Red Hat comment.

For example if we had the following interchange with a 1 hour SLA case, this would be the current behavior:

   GSS says at 1:00PM: ""Please attach your logs""       -> No SBT
   Customer says at 2:00PM: ""Here are my logs""         -> SBT=3:00PM

The various categories, products, etc to which a user is entitled is stored in an AccessRights object. An EntitlementEngine object populates the AccessRights. Legacy skus are populates from the rules engine (JBoss Rules), while non-legacy entitlements are populated from the entitlement service. EntitlementEngine invokes AccessRights.addProduct() for non-legacy entitlements. This method stores the products internally in a collection. Legacy products/entitlements are stored in a separate collection and appear to be populated soley from the rules engine when the rules file, entitlement.drl, is processed.

DownloadManagerParentAction.createLinks() is the method that populates the request with the content that will get displayed in the sidebar. DownloadManagerParentAction calls EntitlementUtil.hasAccessToSupportedProject() with different arguments to determine what to which products the user has access. From EntitlementUtil.hasAccessToSupportedProject(), we eventually wind up calling AccessRights.hasProjectAccess().

Running through the debugger revealed that hasProjectAccess() was always returning false because it checks only the collection of legacy products/projects. This particular user only has non-legacy entitlements. Interestingly, AccessRights does not even have a method for determining acces to non-legacy stuff. For some of the work I did under JBNET-1878, I wound up implementing AccessRights.hasProductAccess(); however, this is only in HEAD and only called for a couple different products.","24/Jan/08 9:40 AM;jsanda;Attaching my working copy of AccessRights.java. I have modified addProduct() to update both the products and projectAccess collection. This appears to fix the bug; however, this is probably not a suitable solution as it does not address the larger issue of handling legacy entitlements versus non-legacy entitlements.","24/Jan/08 5:47 PM;jsanda;I reproduced this issue locally with a different user and a different entitlement. Here are the steps I took:

* Remove all entitlements in SEP for user
* Verify that nothing shows up in downloads menu.
* Add non-legacy entitlement for Application Server by populating customer_entitlement_cache.
* Still nothing shows up in downloads menu.
* Add entitlemet for Application Server in SEP (which populates user_entitlements table)
* Now Application Platform and Developer Subscription show up in menu.

There is code that gets called to map legacy to non-legacy entitlements in EntitlementEngine.processEntitlementsByLegacy(); however that method is only executed when the user already has legacy entitlements. That method is called from processLegacyEntitlements().

private void processLegacyEntitlements(AccessRights rights)
{
    // process rules file....
    for (Entitlements entitlement : entitlements)
    {
        ....
        processEntitlementsByLegacy(rights, entitlement);
    }
    ....
}

The entitlements collection that we iterate through is injected by EntitlementsDAOBean and comes from the user_entitlements table. And of course, the user doesn't have anything (at least not active) in user_entitlements. More over, non-legacy stuff winds up getting added to the map AccessRights.products, and AccessRights does not expose any methods for checking what's in that map.",29/Jan/08 11:17 AM;jsanda;Attaching a spreadsheet received from the business side.

it does not work in Safari. German is my first Language preference for the whole system.

It is ok that German is not supported as locale in IT/CSP, but I guess that more users (== customers) will see the same issue.
My locale settig should be de_DE.

I am not talking about the inside view, but the customer facing CSP.

I don't see the issue with FireFox2, so it is not a high priority.

","22/Jan/08 3:16 PM;mamburn;I have been able to replicate this in Firefox by removing all languages but German [de].

Apparently, the CSP is not able to fall back to the default localization.

Fortunately, all modern browsers with the exception of Safari are configured to send at list of supported languages. Normally, the CSP would filter this list to find the first language it supported and find one. With Safari, there are two problems:
1. Language/locale preferences for Safari are derived from the OS, not a browser setting.
2. Safari is built atop the Webkit project, which has a known limitation whereas it only sends a single locale. Therefore, even though the OS is configured with a cascade of supported languages, only the first is ever sent to the web site. Considering the aforementioned defect in the CSP, if this first language is not a supported localization, the presentation will be muffled.

Unfortunately, the individual that coded all of our internationalization is no longer with us. Therefore, it may take a while before we can fix this.","28/May/08 4:17 PM;mamburn;This is a duplicate of the ""no default locale"" bug.

Nov 14 04:05:15 mgalgoci-    and type getent passwd jboss
Nov 14 04:05:25 wfoster-push    the entry for csp1.app.phx.redhat.com
Nov 14 04:05:43 mgalgoci-    [root@cspserver2 jbossas]# getent passwd jboss
Nov 14 04:05:43 mgalgoci-    jboss:x:101007:101007::/usr/share/jboss:/bin/bash
Nov 14 04:05:43 mgalgoci-    [cspserver2.app.phx.redhat.com] [04:05:13 AM]
Nov 14 04:05:55 mgalgoci-    so the old jbossas user was deleted
Nov 14 04:05:57 wfoster-push    yes
Nov 14 04:05:59 mgalgoci-    and a new one was created
Nov 14 04:06:02 wfoster-push    that's part of the rpm process
Nov 14 04:06:06 mgalgoci-    and all the uids and gids are fucked
Nov 14 04:06:14 mgalgoci-    your file permissions
Nov 14 04:06:15 wfoster-push    we arent using jbossas anymore
Nov 14 04:06:18 wfoster-push    we are using jbossasws-all
Nov 14 04:06:23 mgalgoci-    regardless
Nov 14 04:06:26 mgalgoci-    and all the uids and gids are fucked
Nov 14 04:06:27 wfoster-push    and there is a script to change those files in the filer
Nov 14 04:06:45 wfoster-push    are you talking about the shared NFS mount?
Nov 14 04:06:51 mgalgoci-    among other things
Nov 14 04:06:56 mgalgoci-    but look at this uid/gid
Nov 14 04:07:04 mgalgoci-    that's overlapping with nis
Nov 14 04:07:17 mgalgoci-    it's not using a system level uid/gid allocation
Nov 14 04:07:51 bean2    mgalgoci-: that's not wfoster-push fault, that was something done by RE... and I believe it was done for partner center as well.
Nov 14 04:07:55 wfoster-push    I understand that may be a problem
Nov 14 04:44:03 mgalgoci-    well the user is called jboss
Nov 14 04:44:05 mgalgoci-    <mgalgoci-> [root@cspserver2 jbossas]# getent passwd jboss

Nov 14 04:44:27 mgalgoci-    when we get our next hire, they're going to get that uid/gid because it's the next one available
Nov 14 04:44:35 mgalgoci-    and then jboss will be running as them
Nov 14 04:44:53 wfoster-push    mgalgoci-, I really don't know why that is, then
Nov 14 04:45:14 mgalgoci-    it's because we trusted the new rpm to create the jboss user properly
Nov 14 04:45:17 bean2    mgalgoci-: this is a guess, but I think this ID was provided to RE by the Java team when they put Partner Center Online. We use the same SPEC file for their jboss install
Nov 14 04:45:39 mgalgoci-    bean2: that is RETARDED
Nov 14 04:45:41 wfoster-push    and add it to cfengine
Nov 14 04:45:48 mgalgoci-    wfoster-push: I just did that
Nov 14 04:45:52 wfoster-push    ok ty
Nov 14 04:46:04 mgalgoci-    bean2: that's a big problem that needs fixing
Nov 14 04:46:10 mgalgoci-    it's got potential sarbox implications
Nov 14 04:46:31 bean2    mgalgoci-: I am sure ashcrow-zZz will be more than happy to get this issue fixed
Nov 14 04:46:44 fmerenda    fyi, you can change our user id and run the fix permissions script whenever you want to fix our stuff, so we will not bottleneck you guys when this gets fixed
Nov 14 04:46:56 mgalgoci-    the java team should not be allowed to make any unix system decisions
Nov 14 04:46:59 mgalgoci-    :P
Nov 14 04:48:20 bean2    mgalgoci-: agreed, like I said maybe they said 'pick an id' and we at 'RE' did it... either way... I don't know even if we did if we consulted with someone before doing it. But I will guarantee you, I will let ashcrow-zZz know about it, and we will come up with some solution to fix this

changing URL of new CSP causes RSS feed and software installation issues in JBoss ON,JBNET-1845,12346636,Bug,Closed,JBNET, JBoss Network - Support (CLOSED),software,frank.merenda,"JBoss Network is a value add service offering for JBoss, Inc. customers.",,Blocker,Done,,JessicaSant,JessicaSant,05/Oct/07 5:24 PM,18/Feb/08 12:06 PM,29/Nov/16 3:17 PM,08/Oct/07 2:38 PM,CSP-1.3.1,,CSP-1.3.1,,Software Downloads,,,,0,"This is a ""holder"" issue to list any and all issues that will arise because the URL for the CSP is changing.

The situation is this:
The current URL that a JBoss ON user subscribes to is: https://network.jboss.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/feed/software.html?product=all&downloadType=all&flavor=rss&version=&jonVersion=1.4
Once this new CSP is released, the URL will be something like: https://support.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/feed/software.html?product=all&downloadType=all&flavor=rss&version=&jonVersion=1.4

TODO: need to make sure that the RSS feed is correctly redirected

The problem with the new URL is the following
The RSS feed is made up of a list of tems, each item is identified by a unique URL, like this:
<rdf:Seq>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource=""http://cspserver2.app.dev.redhat.com:8080/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=363""/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource=""...... />
   <rdf:li rdf:resource=""...... />
</rdf:Seq>
it then looks for an rdf:about tag for that same url to find out more info for that item (title, description, installation instructions, etc) JON uses that URL as the unique ID for that resource and uses that to know if an item has been updated in the RSS feed (say we change the installation instructions for something)

PROBLEM: If one day a user subscribes to network.jboss.com/rss and gets all 400 software items and the next day the feed is redirected to support.redhat.com/rss then they're going to get 400 NEW, duplicate software items.  If we make any updates to a particular software item (correcting the MD5, changing installation instructions, or the name of the file), then the update will be applied to the newer version of the software item (the support.redhat.com version) and the older version will become out of date.

PROBLEM:  On the user's ""Software"" tab, where it shows them which Cumulative Patches can be applied to a particular JBoss AS instance, each CP will be listed twice.
TODO: we need to figure out what happens if a user tries to apply a network.jboss.com version of a patch -- will the download still succeed?

POTENTIAL SOLUTION:
Force the RSS feed to use the originally published RDF:ABOUT urls for each item in the RSS feed. 
In other words, if an item was originally released on the old CSP, it will need to maintain the url it was originally published with (i.e. xxx)
If the item is first being released on the new CSP, it can use whatever rdf:about URL from that server
*hopefully* this will be an easy thing to do because all software items with the id PACK-470-ish or under were originally published on the old CSP

NOTE: the OLD rdf:about tags looked like this:
<item rdf:about=""https://network.jboss.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=a0430000006wu7hAAA"">
whereas the new rdf:about tags look like this:
<item rdf:about=""http://cspserver2.app.dev.redhat.com:8080/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=363"">

the FULL url must be identical for any software item originally published under the old CSP (including the softwareId parameter at the end)

PROBLEM: The same problem exists for the ""PRODUCT"" that each software item refers to. It has a tag like this: rdf:about=""https://network.jboss.com/jbossnetwork/rss/product#SOFT-0087"" that is used by JON to uniquely identify each product.

This may be less of an issue than the actual software repository items' url changing, because the products are not listed in JON UI, however it will cause teh # of products stored in the database to double.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JBNET-2136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,1|hzi1uf:,165729,,,,,,,,,,"08/Oct/07 2:36 PM;JessicaSant;Frank-
This works now. 

To test it I did the following:
* subscribe to the original network.jboss.com feed and get all of the software loaded in my local JON DB
* subscribed to the new cspserver2 feed - and all the items were ""updated"" rather than added

The only thing we can't test at the moment is to make sure that 
The current URL :(https://network.jboss.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/feed/software.html?product=all&downloadType=all&flavor=rss&version=&jonVersion=1.4) will correctly be redirected to

Frank,
I did some digging to try to understand Francois' test results from yesterday. 

According to Nathan, the only group SLA that is tied to group id 1401 is a Silver sla.   Based on this query:

 mysql> select * from group_sla where gid = 1401;
 +----+------+---------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
 | id | gid  | service_level | initial_sev1     | initial_sev2     | initial_sev3 | initial_sev4    | subsequent_sev1  | subsequent_sev2  | subsequent_sev3 | s ubsequent_sev4 |
 +----+------+---------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
 | 46 | 1401 | Silver        | 4 business hours | 4 business hours | 1 business day | 2 business days | 4 business hours | 4 business hours | 1 business day  | 2 business days |
 +----+------+---------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+--

Looking at the UI to SEP, I see a mix of Platinum and Silver entitlements:
Existing Entitlements
Name     Type     Level     End Date     Active
Application Server                 supported_project     Platinum     Nov 14, 2007     true

JBoss Messaging                 supported_project     Platinum     Nov 14, 2007     true    
Knowledge                         jbn_module     Silver     Nov 14, 2007     true    
Software     jbn_module     Silver     Nov 14, 2007     true    
Tomcat     supported_project     Platinum     Nov 14, 2007     true    

I'm told by Nathan that there are no product SLAs for legacy entitlements, so only the group is used. 

Now, legacyUser10 has ""platinum"" products listed in his entitlements, but the only SLA in the db is Silver.  This *may* explain why FD was not getting platinum response time SLAs as he expected.   I'm not 100% comfortable or qualified to be troubleshooting this, but I thought I'd throw this out there to you guys.

Thanks

During yesterday's call, we discussed the actual calculation rule of the TSB (Time of Service Breach) for 2-biz days cases (see FD27 in UAT spreadsheet, ""Severity of bugs"" tab).

My expectation was:

* Case 1 = open time is during business hours (TZ of the CSP user)
[TSB = open time + 2 business days]
Examples:
- Open time is Tuesday 10am, TSB is Thursday 10am
- Open time is Thursday 4pm, TSB is Monday (next week) 4pm

* Case 2 = open time is outside of business hours (TZ of the CSP user)
[TSB = 9am of first biz day + 2 business days]
Examples:
- Open time is Tuesday 11pm, TSB is Friday 9am (clock starts Wed 9am)
- Open time is Saturday 4am, TSB is Wednesday 9am (clock starts Mon 9am)

I have attached three screenshots of existing SF.com cases (18393, 18553 and 18555). It shows that the current rules in SF.com are netiher what I describe above nor what I found in QA yesterday.

**Case 18383:
Opened out of biz hours                   : Sat 9/22 at 11:42am
Time of Escalation (right side of screen) : Wed 9/26 at 11:00am
I do not know why it calculated 11am and not 11:42am... Apart from this ""rounding"", it seems that the calculation rule is using 11:00 on Monday as the starting point, then adding two days. If this is the case, this is wrong... My expectation here would have been Wed 9/26 at 9:00am, ie start point is expected to be first biz day at 9am (time of the CSP user). See rule 2 above.

**Case 18553:
Opened out of biz hours                   : Tue 10/2 at 07:20am
Time of Escalation (right side of screen) : Thu 10/4 at 07:20am
This one is adding two days to the time of entry, which is wrong, since the time of entry is out of biz hours. The clock starts at 9am, not before. So TSB should be Thu 10/4 at 9am here. Here, the difference is not huge because it was close to 9am anyway but it can be very different if the case is opened at 10pm the day before for instance. For such cases, we are not supposed to address then before the next day at 9am. This is the principle behind this. This why the clock should only start the next biz day at 9am. This is the basic principle of rule 2 above.

**Case 18555:
Opened out of biz hours                   : Tue 10/2 at 09:31am
Time of Escalation (right side of screen) : Thu 10/4 at 09:31am
This is an ""easy"" one, ie case is opened during biz hours (time of the CSP user) and there is no week-end in the middle, so TSB is just 2 days later at the same time. That's the simple one (see rule 1 above, first example).

I logged in as cspuser03/redhat. When I clicked on submit the first
time, the only field with some data in it was the case title and the
product pick-list (Dev-JGroups). So the page is expected to come back
with 4 red messages: 1 for Missing version, 1 for missing module, 1 for
missing severity and 1 for missing comment. However, only the following
message appeared (see below), ie the red lines for version and module
did not show up.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All fields are required with the exception of ""Environment"".
Attachments are not required.
Please Choose a Severity Level (IN RED)
Comment Required (IN RED)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Then I clicked on submit with version chosen and the same 4 lines as
above showed up, which is correct. Then I clicked on submit with a sev
level chosen and then the only red line left was the ""Comment Required"",
which is also correct. Then I put a comment and clicked on submit and it
created case 145225, which was hopefully the expected behaviour as well.

So the only little issue is on the error message when version/modules
are missing.

Fdechery: We need to discuss this further before engaging too much resources on this because the issue is bigger than this FD22 bug from a GSS perspective. So whatever we do here on 1.3.1, it should not be too sophisticated because this is part of a broader subject that should be part of the 1.4 specifications. In short: how to deal with the specifics of each CSP user profiles? When it was only JBoss, it was relatively simple to have one unique design and logic for any case created by any JBoss customer. Now, we already see that the design and logic is not exactly the same within JBoss between Dev-only profiles and Dev-Prod profiles or even Prod-only profiles. The question becomes even more complex when you factor in RHEL customers, Command Center customers, partners (several types), etc. So I think we need to add this dimension and make sure we design a case opening page that can better handle these different profiles. Whether it is a separate page per profile or a dynamic page according to the user profile, it is a design/technical question. But the sooner we address this, the better we will be in terms of multi-product support.

""Product not listed"" is for CSP users who do not find the product they
would like to pick in the pick-list to describe their issue. So it
should not be mixed with the rest of the actual product pick-list. This

Francois also said that while this is important, this was not a showstopper and he was open to other potential options to allow the user to indicate they were entering a case on a ""Product not listed"" - see below:
""  ""Product not listed"" is just NOT a product, ie not a valid item of the pick-list. This is why it should either be at the end of the pick-list or outside of the pick-list. The hard coding is just coming from the fact that by introducing ""Product not listed"" as a systematic item in the products of a SKU, you introduce an anomaly that the dynamic pick-list cannot deal with, except if you hard code, I agree. So the root cause of the pbm is there: it should not be part of the products. At a spec level, I confirm that ""Product not listed"" right in the middle of the other items, that are REAL products, is not correct. From a design perspective, there are many different ways to address this. You could for instance remove ""Product unlisted"" from the pick-list and add a button or check-box next to the pick-list for users who indeed did not find their product in the list. This button would imply specific code but would avoid the hard code in the pick list. So either the user has picked a product or has checked the ""Product unlisted"" checkbox or radio button. The two are exclusive of course. ""","22/Jun/08 6:20 PM;mamburn;Request is poor usability.

This issue seems to be related to issue FD16. Case 144887 was created
with ""Hibernate"" selected in the Product pick-list. Due to an apparent
mapping issue between ""Hibernate"" and a Product group (=support queue)
in I-T, this case has been apparently assigned to a special group named
""UNKNOWN"".
As said in issue FD16, the expectation is that, if there is a
mapping problem between the product/module selected by the CSP user and
a support queue in I-T (a ""product"" group), then:
A- the system should catch this error and send a special error message
to the I-T admin group (assuming that such an entity exists)
B- the UNKNOWN group should be a group that all I-T users belong to by
default, so that everybody in I-T sees that case, instead of nobody

Case 144887 does NOT show up in fdechery's views in I-T. The product of
this case is ""Hibernate"". At the same time, case 144886 created by the
same CSP user ""cspuser04"", with product = Application Platform, is
visible. I checked the following in I-T:
=> In Group Preferences in I-T, fdechery is enabled (checked box) for
Hibernate in two columns => ""Show Group"" and ""Notify on all events""
=> Case 144887's product *IS* Hibernate
So my expectation is to see this case 144887 like any other case related
to I-T (product) groups that I belong to.
PLEASE NOTE that 144887 shows up in I-T as assigned to ""UNKNOWN"" group
(see bug report FD17). Maybe this explains why it is not visible by
fdechery. My fear is that belonging to ""UNKNOWN"" makes the case
""invisible"" in I-T... which is definitely a bug. IOW, if there is a
mapping problem between the product/module selected by the CSP user and
a support queue in I-T (a ""product"" group), then:
A- the system should catch this error and send a special error message
to the I-T admin group (assuming that such an entity exists)
B- the UNKNOWN group should be a group that all I-T users belong to by
default, so that everybody in I-T sees that case, instead of nobody.

When looking at the details of a case in I-T, the ""Time to Service

Note 1: For case 144884, created in the same context as 144883 (and at
the same time), the ""Time to Service breach"" info is correctly
displayed. Works also for case 144890.
Note 2: For case 144887, the actual ""Time to Service breach"" field does
not show up at all on the screen.

In the ""Issue Information"" section of a support case in I-T, the
""Product"" field is empty. What is expected here is the technical
component that the CSP user has picked when creating the case. Warning:
I know that today, the ""product"" is the commercial product like
Application Platform or Hibernate Framework. However, the *actual*
product that should be displayed here is the technical component on
which the CSP user has an issue. Ideally, the two could be displayed, ie
Product/Module. For instance, the CSP user had picked ""Enterprise
Application Platform"" in the Product pick-list, ""4.2"" in the version
pick-list and ""Messaging"" in the Module pick-list then these three
elements should just be displayed here in the same order. If only one
field has to be displayed however, this should be the ""Module"" pick-list.

case 144890 was created with jBPM as the product. In I-T, the only

customer group of that case (customer is ""CSPTestCustomerE"") and the

Sorry, no comprendo... No habla IssueTrackerish.

However, here are my comments:

First, at the time of its creation in the CSP, a case cannot belong to several support queues. The product picked by the CSP user when creating the case should defined the (unique) support group to which the case is routed. So it cannot belong to two groups at that stage.

Secondly, how can a support case be ""entered to ticket_groups twice""? This is not something that should happen so I assume that the CSP has written it twice in the I-T database at the time I submitted it as a CSP user?
I assume there might be a minor bug somewhere in CSP that it did
duplicated entries in the ticket_groups table.

I'm not sure how salesforce records the time in the database. If there is a 4 hour offset for all the comments migrated from SF, my best guess is that SF saves the time in UTC in the database.

I-T saves the time according to the App server time(the current time measured in the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch).

etc, ie these three steps repeat infinitely because the case does not 
get created until a version or a module are chosen

Comments:
- The fact that the case is not accepted/created unless a version and 
module have been picked is an improvement, ie this is the expected 
behaviour.
- However, the remaining bug is that after the first submit, the pick 
lists for version and module do not work anymore.

If you click on ""Submit"" for a new case without having chosen a
version
and a module in the pick-list, you get an error message asking you to
choose a version and a module and you stay on the same case creation
page. If you then try to choose a version and a module, these two
pick-list are now empty. They were not before, ie before the first
""Submit"". Since you cannot choose anything, you can however click on
""Submit"" a second time. This time you do not get any error message and
the case is actually created.
=> NOTE: I have not tested it specifically for the Product pick-list 
but
it may be the same behaviour.

Possible bug report if that makes sense.

The code from earlier this year that was added for Sev1 cases for Platinum customers - this may not be firing.  I thought my test cases this weekend should have fired off that business rule to get the popup, but I never saw it.  It could be that 1)my popup blocker killed it  2)my entitlements were wrong.  So there's a reasonable chance this is user error.

A customer complained he was unable to download the JBoss ON 1.4.31.SP2 AIX agent (https://network.jboss.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=a0430000007iyRDAAY)
(I can see that the customer has tried to download the 1.4.31 AIX agent multiple times (see ""download audits"" https://na1.salesforce.com/a0430000007iyRD) - the file name is: JBoss_Operations_Network_Agent_ppc_aix_1.4.31.tgz)

I'm able to download it using IE6, Firefox and Opera -- HOWEVER, using Vista + IE7 the download does not work: the user is not presented with the ""Accept license"" page, so the download itself doesn't even attempt to start.

We had this issue previously with IE6 when the content type was set to ""application/octet-stream"" instead of ""application/x-gzip""  - I've verified that this file has the correct content type on both download01 and download02 -- the IE6 issue is discussed here in their docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp",Windows Vista Ultimate + IE7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21/Aug/07 10:35 AM;network_error_message.JPG;https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12315617/network_error_message.JPG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,6.0,,1|hzi2cv:,165812,,,,,,,,,,"21/Aug/07 10:34 AM;JessicaSant;received a reply from the customer:

many thanks for your answer. I'm using the IE6 on Windows XP Professional, but the download today failed again. I added a screenshot of the error message

All other downloads are okay, is there another way to download the aix-agent. I need it asap. Many, many thanks.

will find out what other files they're able to download and at which step the AIX agent download fails (if they're presented with the ""accept license"" screen, or if the download itself is failing -- will attach customer's screenshot to this issue

Suppose I remove the applicationmessages_ja file, and my browser locale is set to ja-JP.
If I'm hitting a page that uses applicationmessages, I'll get Chinese.
I would expect to get the values from the default applicationmessage file.
Just wondering where that logic was set.

What file did you remove and why?

I can't think of a reason why they would get ZH when JA is specified,
other than ordering of browser preferences. If the order of preferred
langs is JA, ZH, then EN in your browser, then that is how it will be
matched if one localization cannot be found.

<mamburn> is that new or old?
<llu> mamburn, corrupted?
<mamburn> yes, corrupted
<llu> i'm not sure what you mean by corrupted...
<llu> can you provide more details...
<mamburn> i mean it won't open because the filesystem says ""can't open file. it appears to be corrupted""
<mamburn> nlugert confirmed he also can't download
<nlugert> yep
<mamburn> appears to happen to image files (jpg, png)
<mamburn> zip files seem to upload/download ok
<mamburn> i.e. if you upload a PNG, it will download ""corrupted""
<mamburn> if you upload a zipped version of a PNG, the zip will download OK
<dfisher> I'm guessing if you md5sum they'll come up different.
<mamburn> can you say that in English? =)
<dfisher> mamburn are you on windows or linux?
<dfisher> If you're on linux, can you run the following from the command line:
* fmerenda has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
<mamburn> i'm on mac, ngluert tried from rhel
<dfisher>  /usr/bin/file image_you_downloaded_from_it_thats_corrupted.jpg
<dfisher> I think Mac's have the 'file' command.
<mamburn> dfisher - not sure i understand your point
<dfisher> In theory it should say what type of file you've downloaded.
<dfisher> I'm wondering if maybe the header's the part that's corrupted.
<nlugert> doesn't work on windows either
<nlugert> i tried on rhel and win
<dfisher> I'm not saying file's going to solve the problem.
<mamburn> i don't think it's a problem with the file
<dfisher> I'm trying to help figure out what the problem is.
<mamburn> since i can upload in IT and download in CSP
<mamburn> i just can't download in IT
<mamburn> i = no one so far on mac, rhel, or win
<dfisher> Can you point me to the corrupted file?
<mamburn> https://cspserver2.app.dev.redhat.com/issue-tracker/?module=issues&action=view&tid=128263&gid=1172
<nlugert> must be how IT gets the bytes

The download url is not correct, it should be starting with a ""1"", not a 5.

When I added an attachment in IT, it shows up on the case in IT, but not in CSP. When I try to download the exact same file in IT that i just uploaded, I get a 404 error just like above.

The file in IT was added at:

The 404 error in IT is:

Again, this is not the correct URL.

The attachment does not show up at all in the CSP. This CSP code has not changed in a while. I believe this is an IT bug.

I noticed there is no download directory under issue-tracker/ on QA. That's probably why the download doesn't work.
I've checked in a script you can run to create the download dir
You can find it at 
portal/bin/download_dir.sh

By the way, the way how download works iswhen a user tries to download a file, a dynamic linnk is created in this fashion
  /issue-tracker/download/first_digit_of_userid/userid/prestring-filename

Lisa","14/Mar/07 2:06 PM;ahmadgt;I thought this was configure to be /var/files

define(""_FILEPATH_"",""/var/files"");

We cannot have a download dir under issue-tracker because it will not work in a clustered environment.","14/Mar/07 2:53 PM;frank.merenda;Lisa,

Also, if you add an attachment in IT and try to get it in IT the URL is incorrect. The example is above. There is some problem in IT. You can see that the file is added in close to the correct place, but the url it is looking for after is not even close.

I am pretty sure this stuff is all related.

-Frank","15/Mar/07 11:51 AM;llu;Frank,

I still don't see issue-tracker/download directory on QA. Please run 
issue-tracker/download.dir.sh

I'll continue to debug once that's done. 

thanks,
Lisa","15/Mar/07 11:59 AM;frank.merenda;Lisa,

I ran the script and IT can add/remove attachments. 

Please add these directories in the IT build. :)

Problems still: 

Adding attachment in CSP works, and IT views them.
Adding attachment in IT does not enter data correctly, the attachment does not show up in the CSP at all.

So, IT sees the attachments added in the CSP OK.
When IT adds attachments, the event is not processed correctly, and we do not get an attchment showing up in the CSP.

I think we have a bigger problem. I-T events on QA are all messed up for both JBoss groups and RHEL groups.

I need to check who was the last time modifed the I-T code:-(

Hi Lisa,

This user tried to reset his password using the 'Lost Password' link on
Oct. 11 @ 2:20 pm EST. He did receive any emails for over 40 minutes and
finally called me. I reset his password manually @ 3:35 pm. Attached is
his screenshot. Thanks!

Hi Henry,

Yes, I just manually reset the password. According to the DBA, if you
click on the ""Forgot Password"" link, that is an automated
process...She's looking at the logs right now to see if your first
request was ever received. Thanks.

In IT 96405, I sent two old events to the BZ, which became comments 2
and 3.  They are out of order, though.  Comment 3 is the newer IT event,
but it became the older BZ comment.

Is this because I have my preferences in IT set to ""All Events, newest
first""?  I'm using the beta interface btw.

When doing and ""Advanced Search"" on IT, where multiple fields can be
selected, once the search results are displayed, if you click on ""Alter
View"", none of the fields and values previously selected remain.
Actually it takes you back to ""Simple Search"" instead.

I tried using the back bottom on the browser, from the search results

After typing in the comment into an issue and pressing the [Commit

case.  However  if the password has timed out, IT will bring you to the
password page to re-authenticate. After it re-authenticates, IT reloads
the case. However all your changes have been discarded and the time
spent to gather  informaton and document it is lost and has to be redone.

When entering something into issue-tracker, if the session happens to time out, when you click the 'commit event' button, you are redirected to the Issue-Tracker login screen and once you've entered your user name and password you are sent back to the issue you were working on, but all you've typed is gone!

I've created an attachment to issue number 51795 that contained a `#'
character.  The customer couldn't download it.  The error message you
get when you attempt to download it is:

The requested URL /issue-tracker/download/6/638/IT was not found on this server.
Since the name of the file was IT#51795-..., I suppose the `#'
character is being cut-off.  Indeed, the attachment download attempt
gets redirected to:

https://enterprise.redhat.com/issue- tracker/download/6/638/IT#51795-ld-infinite-loop-overriding-wait.patch< br />
and that doesn't work.  If I replace the `#' character with `%23', I
can obtain the file contents, so it doesn't seem to be a problem in
the file store or in the code to obtain the file contents, but rather
with missing quoting in the URL redirection code.

Hope this helps,

You *could* since the customer isn't logging directly into issue tracker put all of the JBoss Products linked to the escalation group; however, if a technician ever is allowed to create cases, it will behave badly.  They will create issue, pick the customer, then have nothing in the product pick list.  The best way to do this would be to modify your migration script so that when it creates a customer (such as Cox Communications) it links the products (Apache, nHibernate, etc).  Then if a case is created in the customer group, the technician picks the product and clicks ""commit,"" it will auto escalate to the proper group.

If a ticket is escalated to one of the ""JBoss Escalation"", instead of forcing the comment to be private. I made the change following what you showed me in Sales Force. Please take a look at my test issue. If it works for you, i can check in the code the CVS.

thanks,

What I saw was the customer account list had 2 odd ones to start.  I pulled this out of the view source for the page so you could see the number:

the reason product dropdown is empty is because certain groups are not setup properly on DEV.

i.e.

 A new comment has been added to your case ""I didn\'t attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying that I approved of it."" (Case Number 110426).

this is caused by issue tracker escaping strings before entering text into the database. the CSP escapes them before displaying them.

if a case is entered in the CSP by the customer, it works OK. If a employee enters a "" or ' in a comment, or edits the name of the case, it will display in the csp as escaped, i.e.  this is a mess\'ed up thingy.


Moved to CSP-1.1 since this is very low-impact.

potential security issues in the Issue Tracker XMLRPC interface.

We've verified today that a user with a valid issue tracker username and 
password can perform SQL injection using this interface remotely (outside 
of Red Hat intranet).

A malicious user could query any database table, reset any users password, 
or cause damage by dropping tables.  Additionally any user with a valid 
issue tracker username and password can read the details of any ticket, 
even private comments.

I have a proof of concept for this (it's trivial but mail me if you need 
it for verification).

This is an issue we'd rate as having a critical security severity and it 
therefore needs to be addressed immediately.  I realise that the interface 
is essential for bugzilla and internal tool integration and disabling it 
would have major consequences; therefore an acceptable interim solution 
would be to restrict this interface to Red Hat internal IPs until such 
time as it can be fixed.  I've therefore cc'd SOC in case you need their 
assistance with this.

","22/Dec/06 3:16 PM;llu;Frank,

I probably didn't make it clear earlier. The problem is not in the group of userid. It's rather the ticket gid and ticket_group gid. 

In issue-Tracker, you can only open ticket in a group that you are a member of. And with the proper priv. to open/update tickets. 
You should never open any ticket in issue-tracker group [Red Hat]. this group does not handle tickets.
since aaslami@redhat.com is a super user, he can open a new ticket in any group. As long as the group is not one of the following:
 * Red Hat
 * Management / Executive Adjust Scoring

Here is what I had to do to fix IT_95955
  UPDATE tickets set gid=765 WHERE tid=95955;
  UPDATE ticket_groups set gid=795, show_issue='t' where tid=95955;
  
  **please note, show_issue='t'. It was NULL which will not showup properly in Issue-Tracker views.
",02/Jan/07 12:00 PM;frank.merenda;I have updated the create_case functionality so that it sets show_issue to 't' when a case is created.,,,,,,,,

Improve Issue tracker and Bugzilla communication,JBNET-889,12331834,Bug,Resolved,JBNET, JBoss Network - Support (CLOSED),software,frank.merenda,"JBoss Network is a value add service offering for JBoss, Inc. customers.",,Major,Done,llu,llu,llu,30/Nov/06 12:03 PM,28/Jun/07 12:12 PM,29/Nov/16 3:18 PM,28/Jun/07 12:12 PM,CSP-1.5,,CSP-1.3,,Issue Tracker,,,,0,"Minutes from IT/Bugzilla Meeting on Tuesday 28 Nov 2006

Attendees:
Marco Bill-Peter
Lisa Davidson
Bob Johnson
Archana Raghavan
Chris Williams (telecon)

Purpose:
How to tweak Bugzilla/IT to communicate better and relieve TAM/PM button
pushing where it's unnecessary.

Details:

Recommendations:
* Eliminate the ""Public in Issue Tracker"" in Bugzilla
  This button was never promoted and is seldom used. When it is, there 
  are potential design flaws. Point below removes the necessity for 
  this button.
  Resp: Troan to open Bugzilla against Bugzilla to get this removed

* Engineers must make comments public unless there is a specific reason
  to make them private in the bugzilla.
  Resp: Ken Reilly to send note informing of this new policy. After 
  that, if there are offenders, send them email explaining the error
  of their ways. Subsequent violations to result in (TBD).

* Bugzilla RHEL-Beta Group and public bugs should have no effect on
  the propagation of comments from Bugzilla to Issue Tracker and vice
  versa. If the group IT flag ""Should public comments from Bugzilla be
  allowed?"" is set, THEN
  a) public comments in a public or beta bug should be copied to
     the corresponding issue tracker(s) as public comments
  b) public comments in a bug with one or more partner confidential
     flags set should appear in the corresponding partner issue
     trackers as public.
  c) public comments in an issue tracker should be propagated to the
     corresponding bug as privateould be provate in the Bugzilla 
     - make by either non-Red Hat or Red Hat people in Issue Tracker
     - would like public IT comments to propagate to a corresponding
       partner confidential bug to be public but not sure if this is
       feasible
  d) private comments made in Issue Tracker should be private in the 
     bug as well 
     - auto-propagated by both non-Red Hat and RH Issue Tracker IDs
  Resp: Lisa Davidson and Kevin Baker.

* Keyword in Bugzilla ""SEG"" indicating SEG had sanitized the bug
  Purpose is to track bugzillas that have been blessed by SEG either
  by SEG escalation to Bugzilla or after reviewing an already opened
  bug (on-site partner, outside individual, RH Engineering/QA created,
  Fedora created, etc).
  - Bugs not containing this keyword would not be tracked by GSS
  Resp: Bob Johnson to comment further on justification.

* Need Issue Tracker attachments on the specific attachment section
  of Bugzilla  rather than scattered in the comments.
  Resp: Kevin baker

* Need Non-Confidential field in every bugzilla with non confidential
  informational description and resolution. Purpose is to make all bugs
  accessible in a limited fashion for public consumption
  - Being worked upstream 
  Resp: Kevin Baker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PM Approved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,,1|hzhyyn:,165262,,,,,,,,,,"16/Jan/07 8:13 PM;llu;update the due date on this task. Integration of Issue-Tracker and CSP have higher priority.
